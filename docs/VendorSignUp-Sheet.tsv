Modules	Screens Details	Issues details	Query	Answers	Screen status
Vendor Sign-Up	Vendor Auth entry: `SignInVendor` screen provides both **Login** and **Sign up** tabs in one place for vendor onboarding.	No major UI issue; final branding/content can be adjusted if needed.	What is done for Vendor entry screen?	Vendor login + vendor sign-up UI are available in a single screen with tab switching.	Done
Vendor Sign-Up	Vendor Login: email/username + password login with security text (captcha-like) validation, show/hide password, remember me, forgot password link, loader + toast notifications.	Token handling uses cookies + localStorage; relies on backend `/auth/login` response shape consistency.	How vendor login works?	Frontend posts to `/auth/login`, stores JWT token, decodes modules/role, saves vendor user in localStorage + Redux, then navigates to `/dashboard`.	Done
Vendor Sign-Up	Vendor Permissions bootstrap: JWT is decoded, modules map is built (`canRead/canWrite`), permission level derived (READ_ONLY/READ_WRITE) and stored for ProtectedRoute/module gating.	Depends on backend including `modules` in JWT; if missing, gating may need fallback.	How access control is prepared after login?	Modules and permission control are derived from JWT and stored; UI can hide/guard screens based on access.	Done
Vendor Sign-Up	Vendor Sign-Up Step 1 (Business details): Sign-up form collects nameAndTitle, company name, email, contact number and submits to `/signup/vendor/step1`.	Backend validation errors must be shown cleanly; field naming must remain synced with backend DTO.	What is done in vendor sign-up?	Sign-up step1 request is implemented; on success we capture `vendorSignupId` from response.	Done
Vendor Sign-Up	Vendor Sign-Up → Subscription flow linking: after step1 success, user is navigated to `/dashboard_subscription` with `vendorSignupId` in route state.	Depends on subscription endpoints and vendorSignupId returned by backend; add fallback storage if needed.	How onboarding continues after sign-up?	We redirect to subscription selection screen carrying vendorSignupId to proceed with package selection/payment.	Done
Vendor Sign-Up	Dashboard Subscription (plan selection): user selects a plan and frontend calls `/signup/vendor/package`, then moves to SubscriptionPage.	UI exists; payment amounts currently handled in portal flow; needs alignment with mobile in-app subscriptions strategy.	Are subscription plans wired?	Yes, plan selection screen posts package selection for the vendorSignupId and navigates forward in flow.	In Progress
Vendor Sign-Up	Subscription Payment (web flow): subscription summary and “Pay now” triggers `/signup/vendor/payment` then routes to success page.	Currently contains static sample values; final gateway + receipt validation strategy (web vs in-app) must be finalized.	Is payment final in vendor onboarding?	UI and API call exist, but production-grade payment/in-app subscription validation needs final decision and backend implementation.	In Progress
Vendor Sign-Up	Vendor session management: token stored, logout route exists, back button prevention logic is added on vendor sign-in page when logged out.	Edge cases on token expiry/refresh may need improvement.	How vendor session is handled?	Token is stored in cookie/localStorage; logout clears session; basic navigation protection is present.	In Progress
