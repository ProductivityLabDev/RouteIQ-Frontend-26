"Modules","Screens Details","Issues details","Query","Answers","Screen status"
"Admin Interface","Global Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC): after vendor login, the app decodes JWT modules (canRead/canWrite) and enables access based on assigned rights. The sidebar shows only the modules the vendor/user is allowed to view.","Backend must provide consistent module keys inside the JWT; if module naming changes, normalization/mapping needs an update.","How do vendor rights control which modules open?","Both sidebar filtering and route protection enforce permissions: canRead is required to view; canWrite is required for create/edit/delete. If a user tries to open a restricted module, they see an “Access Denied” page.","Completed"
"Admin Interface","Route Guard / ProtectedRoute: all major routes are protected via a route→module mapping (Vehicle, Employee, School, Route, Tracking, Scheduling, Accounting, Access, etc.), with a dedicated Unauthorized page for better UX.","Token expiry validation is currently commented; can be improved with refresh/expiry handling for production hardening.","What level of security/module guarding is implemented?","Per‑route permission checks are implemented; safe routes are allowed, protected routes require explicit module read/write permissions; unauthorized UX is implemented.","Completed"
"Access Management","Access Management (Users & Permissions): user listing (UserCard), Create Access form (CreateAccessCard), edit and delete flows with confirmation modal, and toast/loader feedback.","Roles/terminals/modules APIs must stay stable; if backend response shape changes, mapping updates may be required.","What is completed in Access Management?","Vendor/admin can create and edit users, assign roles, terminals, departments/modules, set Read Only vs Read & Write control, and remove users (soft delete).","Completed"
"Access Management","Module visibility control in sidebar: SchoolDashboardSidebar filters menu items by required module keys (Vehicle/Employee/School/Route/Tracking/Chat/Invoices/Access, etc.) and only shows items where user has canRead=true.","Depends on JWT modules; plural/singular key differences are already handled (basic normalization).","How does the app decide which sidebar items are visible?","If the user has read permission for a module, the menu item is visible; otherwise it is hidden to keep the UI clean and secure.","Completed"
"Vehicle Management","Vehicle module UI & flows: vehicle listing, add vehicle screen, details display, and UI refresh; vehicles are also usable in Route Management dropdowns.","Full CRUD, validations, search/pagination, and status lifecycle (active/maintenance) need completion via backend integration.","What is the current status of Vehicle Management?","Core UI flows are implemented and stable; remaining work is completing API integration, validations, and operational features (maintenance/defects/documents) as per scope.","In Progress"
"Employee Management","Employee module UI & flows: employee listing, add/edit forms, detail views; driver selection is reused inside Route Management.","Document uploads (licenses/certificates), role‑specific rules, full CRUD edge cases, and pagination/search need completion.","What is the current status of Employee Management?","UI CRUD experience is built and data can be displayed; remaining work is backend hardening, document uploads, validations, and permissions fine‑tuning.","In Progress"
"School Management","School module UI & workflow: vendor can add a school, see it in the school listing, and use school selection to drive downstream flows (e.g., student loading/assignment).","Full school CRUD, validations, vendor‑specific permissions, and complete student management under school (bulk import optional) are pending.","What is the vendor workflow in School Management?","Schools can be added and viewed in the portal; selecting a school supports student workflows. Remaining work is completing backend CRUD and student management features.","In Progress"
"Route Management","Route module major progress: route listing + details + create route flow (name/number/date/time, driver, vehicle, school, students). Pickup/dropoff Places Autocomplete is integrated; create‑route API payload mapping was aligned to backend DTO keys.","Route stops/coordinates availability is a backend dependency; edit/delete, stop management, and scheduling linkage are pending.","What is strongly completed in Route Management?","Create Route, correct API mapping, and route map viewing are implemented. Polyline uses Directions when stops exist; if a new route has no stops/coords yet, the UI shows a clear “No stops/coordinates” state (no misleading fake polyline).","In Progress"
"Real Time Tracking","Tracking module UI: tracking screen and map layout are present for route/vehicle tracking.","Live location feed (API/WebSocket), marker updates, polling strategy, and performance tuning are pending.","What is the current status of Real‑time Tracking?","UI is ready; remaining work is integrating live tracking data and implementing reliable real‑time updates.","In Progress"
"Route Scheduling","Route scheduling UI: schedule screens are available and linked from the sidebar.","Scheduling business logic, schedule CRUD APIs, conflict validations, and recurring schedules are pending.","What is the current status of Route Scheduling?","UI structure is ready; remaining work is backend integration and scheduling rules/validations.","In Progress"
"Chat Monitoring","Chat monitoring UI: vendor chat screens/layout are available.","Real-time chat integration, message history APIs, attachments, and moderation tools are pending.","What is the current status of Chat Monitoring?","UI is ready; remaining work is backend/WebSocket integration, attachments, and unread counters.","In Progress"
"Accounting","Accounting UI: dashboards/tables and navigation are available.","Reports/exports/reconciliation and backend integration are pending.","What is the current status of Accounting?","UI is ready; remaining work is accounting data APIs, exports, and calculations validation.","In Progress"
"Feedback","Feedback/support UI exists and supports the intended workflow.","Backend submission/listing and optional notification triggers are pending.","What is the current status of Feedback?","UI is ready; remaining work is backend integration and status tracking if required.","In Progress"
"Documents","Documents UI exists for viewing/management.","AWS S3 upload/download integration, permissions, and metadata/versioning handling are pending.","What is the current status of Documents?","UI is ready; remaining work is storage integration (S3) and access control.","In Progress"
