Modules	Screens Details	Issues details	Query	Answers	Screen status
Route Management	Route Management module setup: Route Management screen + navigation + overall UI flow implemented (admin interface).	No major issue in UI navigation.	Module overall status?	Route module UI is active and connected with related screens (create/view/map).	In Progress
Route Management	Create Route Screen: full form UI created (Route Name, Route Number, Route Date, Route Time).	Form validations + UX polishing as per client feedback may be pending.	What is done in Create Route screen?	Core Create Route form fields are implemented and working with required validations/disabled submit behavior.	Done
Route Management	Create Route: Pickup & Dropoff fields integrated with Google Places Autocomplete (accurate address selection).	Needs Google Maps billing enabled + API key restrictions in production.	How pickup/dropoff is handled?	User selects addresses via Places Autocomplete; we store formatted address/name in form state.	Done
Route Management	Create Route: School selection implemented (Institute/School dropdown) and based on selected school, students load.	Depends on backend student list endpoint stability + mapping.	How school → students flow works?	On selecting a school, system fetches students for that institute and shows them for assignment.	Done
Route Management	Create Route: Students assignment implemented (multi-select / toggle) and converted to payload for backend.	Edge cases: large student lists need search/filter/pagination.	How students are attached to route?	Selected student IDs are collected and sent in request (comma-separated IDs).	Done
Route Management	Create Route: Driver selection implemented (employee dropdown) and driver ID mapping handled (EmpId/EmployeeId).	Data consistency (driver fields) depends on employee API response.	How driver is assigned?	Driver is selected from employees; we map correct ID field and include in payload.	Done
Route Management	Create Route: Bus/Vehicle selection implemented (bus dropdown) and vehicle ID mapping handled (BusId/VehicleId etc.).	Consistency of vehicle identifiers across modules; validations if record missing ID.	How vehicle is assigned?	Vehicle/bus is selected; UI maps correct ID and includes in payload for route creation.	Done
Route Management	Create Route API integration: payload mapping fixed to match backend DTO keys (pickupLocation/dropoffLocation/driverEmployeeId/vehicleId).	Backend strict DTO validation rejects unknown keys; mapping must stay synced with backend.	What issue was solved in API integration?	400 Bad Request was fixed by mapping frontend keys to backend expected DTO keys at service layer before POST.	Done
Route Management	Route Map View: map screen opens for a route and shows route information card (route number/name, schedule, contact/driver, destination).	Depends on route-details endpoint providing consistent fields (routeNumber/RouteName etc.).	What is done in route map view UI?	Map screen loads with route info card and route context; supports back navigation and card controls.	Done
Route Management	Route Polyline Rendering: road-follow polyline implemented using Google DirectionsService when stop coordinates exist (origin → waypoints → destination).	Directions API must be enabled; requires at least 2 stops with lat/lng.	Why polyline differs for some routes?	Old routes with stored stops/coords show accurate road-follow path; new routes without coords cannot generate proper directions.	Done
Route Management	Map Fallback Fix: for newly created routes with missing stops/coords, system no longer draws fake/mock polyline; shows “No stops/coordinates found” message.	Remaining is backend to generate/store stops/coords after route creation.	What fix was applied for new route map confusion?	Mock fallback disabled for route-map mode; user gets clear message until real stops/coords exist.	Done
Route Management	Markers system: supports different marker types (stop/student/bus) styling and ordering for stops (start/mid/end) on map.	Requires correct marker data from backend; student lat/lng availability.	How markers are shown?	Markers are rendered with different icons/styles; stop markers are ordered and used for directions.	In Progress
Route Management	Route data dependencies: route distance/time metrics and details are displayed when available (from API/derived).	Metrics consistency depends on backend data source; needs final standard fields.	What is pending on metrics/details?	Finalize backend fields for distance/duration and keep a single reliable source (API vs Google).	Pending
Route Management	Route Stops workflow (backend dependency): automatic stop generation (from pickup/dropoff or student locations) not fully available yet.	Without stop creation + lat/lng storage, new routes won’t have accurate polyline.	What is the main pending blocker?	Backend needs to store route stops/coordinates after route creation (or geocode) so map can always draw real directions.	Pending
Route Management	Route CRUD (Admin): edit/update/delete route features are not fully completed end-to-end.	Needs full API integration + UI confirmations + audit/logging.	What is pending for full Route Management?	Add route edit/delete, stop management UI (add/reorder), schedule linkage, and stronger validations + error handling.	Pending
